          <h3>Follow the Reaper</h3>
          <p>
            Follow the Reaper is the third studio album by Finnish melodic death
            metal band Children of Bodom, released in Finland in October 2000 by
            Spinefarm Records and in February 2001 internationally by Nuclear
            Blast Records. The album is the first to use a power
            metal-influenced sound in addition to the symphonic metal elements
            from previous albums—present mainly in the keyboards, vocals, and
            fast tempos. Many songs on the album became live setlist favorites,
            such as "Everytime I Die", "Hate Me!", and the title track. The song
            "Mask of Sanity" is a remake of the song "Talking of the Trees" from
            their early demo Shining (released as IneartheD). Follow the Reaper
            was recorded and mixed at Peter Tägtgren's Abyss studio in Sweden,
            instead of the Finnish Astia-studio from Anssi Kippo, in which they
            had recorded all of their previous releases, including the demos
            from IneartheD. On this album, Children of Bodom used D standard
            tuning (D,G,C,F,A,D), which was also used on Hatebreeder. The album
            features sampled quotes from the 1990 film The Exorcist III. A
            deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks was released in 2006.

            Media label. And this is also the final Children Of Bodom album to

            guitarist Alexander Kuoppala, would leave the band in 2005. It was
            successful both in Europe and the USA, which is demonstrated by the
            appearance of the "Needled 24/7" music video on MTV2's Headbangers
            Ball. "Needled 24/7" also featured on the heavy metal documentary

          <h3>Blooddrunk</h3>
          <p>
            Blooddrunk is the sixth album by Finnish melodic death metal band
            Children of Bodom, released on April 7, 2008, through Spinefarm
            Records. The album includes a re-recorded version single for "Tie My
            Rope". Various editions feature one or two cover songs as bonus
            tracks. The limited edition digipak version of the album includes a
            bonus DVD with 5.1 surround mixes of all songs and the video and
            making-of for "Blooddrunk". It sold 20,000 copies during its first
            week of release.[8] The band recorded a cover of the Suicidal
            Tendencies song "War Inside My Head" during the recording sessions
            for this album, but the song was not released on Blooddrunk.[9] The
            song was released on the cover album Skeletons in the Closet
            together with two new covers plus some old ones as well. The song
            "Done With Everything, Die For Nothing" is a playable song in Guitar
            Hero 5, which some players consider to be one of the game's harder
            songs. The album includes more thrash metal than its predecessors.

          <h3>I Worship Chaos</h3>
          <p>
            I Worship Chaos is the ninth studio album by Finnish melodic death
            metal band Children of Bodom. It was released on October 2, 2015.[6]
            It is the first album since 2003's Hate Crew Deathroll not to
            feature guitarist Roope Latvala due to his departure from the band
            in May 2015, making this the band's first album as a four-piece
            group with Alexi Laiho handling all guitar duties. For the first
            time, the band did not use a commercial recording studio. Instead
            they opted to use a converted warehouse to enhance the ambiance of
            the sound.[7] In this album, the band used drop B tuning on most of
            the album and D-flat tuning on the songs "Hold Your Tongue" and
            "Suicide Bomber" instead of drop C tuning and D standard used on
            previous albums. This also makes this the first album since
            Something Wild to use D-flat tuning.

          <h3>Hexed</h3>
          <p>
            Hexed is the tenth and final studio album by Finnish melodic death
            metal band Children of Bodom. It was released on March 8, 2019.[6]
            It is the only album to feature guitarist Daniel Freyberg since he
            became a member of the band in 2016, and also the second album
            (after Relentless Reckless Forever) not to have a song with "Bodom"
            in the title. Most of the songs are tuned in Drop B tuning and
            D-flat tuning, while the songs "This Road" and "Glass Houses" are
            tuned to D tuning. This is the band's first album since Follow the
            Reaper to include neo-classical elements. It is also the last album
            to feature longtime members Jaska Raatikainen, Henkka Seppälä, and
            Janne Wirman, who all quit the band in November 2019. It could also
            be the last to use the Children of Bodom name, as the departing
            members filed for the rights to the name, making it so frontman
            Alexi Laiho must be granted permission from all three to continue
            using the name.
